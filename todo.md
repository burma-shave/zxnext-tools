* [ ] validate tilemap size
* [ ] support tile attributes
* [ ] calculate offset for map data
* [ ] generate code for palette setup and tilemap setup
* [ ] metatile rotation and mirroring?
* [ ] ULA layer support - allow user to define ULA as a layer
  in tiled. This would need to be fudged using a single
  large tile
* [x] output tilemap data optionally in column major order
